        <h3>1. 1931 China Floods
        </h3>
        
<p>1931 Yangtze River Flood <br/>
    Date: August 18, 1931 <br/>
    Location: China<br/>
    Death Toll: Estimated 3.7 million <br/>
    <br/>
    Considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in human history, the great Yangtze River flood of 1931 was one of the deadliest single events of all time. After a period of extreme rainfall, the highly populated Yangtze River basin began to flood. The waters would spread to cover an area of roughly 500-square-miles, forcing half a million people to evacuate. 
    <br/>
    
    The biggest killer of this flood wasn't the water, however. Most deaths occurred due to famine and disease. Rice fields were completely obliterated by the flood, leading to mass starvation in many cities in southern China. The polluted river water also spread infectious diseases throughout the population. Typhoid and dysentery ran rampant, and China's government was ill prepared to deal with the fallout because of an ongoing civil war.

    <h3>2. 1887 Yellow River Flood</h3>

    <p>1938 Yellow River Flood<br/>
        Date: June 1938
        Location: China
        Death Toll: 500,000 - 800,000
        
        While most floods can be considered natural disasters, the 1938 flood of the Yellow River was a deliberate act of warfare. The Chinese had been fighting a brutal Japanese invasion, one that threatened to bring an end to thousands of years of Chinese history. As a last-ditch effort, Commander Chiang Kai-shek ordered the destruction of the river's dike system. This unleashed a wave of flood waters that would spread across the country for nine years. The act is believed to be the most devastating environmental attack of all time, both in terms of environmental destruction and loss of human life. 
        <br/>
        
        Four million people were forced from their homes as the flood spread. The water was not be contained until 1947, years after the Japanese were defeated. The Chinese government denied their involvement in the flooding until news broke in 1945.</p>
  <br/>

  <h3>3. 1938 Yellow River Flood</h3>
  <p>In 1938, the Chinese military opened up levees on the Yellow River to prevent the advancement of the Japanese army, which had taken control of Northern China. It is not known exactly how many, but many Japanese soldiers died in the flooding. However, it also affected the local communities. It is estimated that 800,000-900,000 people died in total, however, that number is not certain. In the war-torn villages, many government officials had already left, so official counts were not always done.
<br/>
    The surrounding area was deeply affected for several years following the flooding. The fields were covered in silt so they were not as fertile. A lot of structures were destroyed. This is considered one of the most significant acts of environmental warfare to ever occur. The river was not returned to its earlier course until 1947.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>
        4. 1975 Banqiao Dam Failure
    </h3>
    <p>During Typhoon Nina, a category 3 storm, over a year’s worth of rainfall (about 3.5 feet) for the area fell in just one day on August 7, 1975. The damn had been built to withstand a “one in a thousand-year” rainfall event of about 1 foot. Due to the dam breaking, the People’s Liberation Army purposely had to destroy other dams further downstream to control the flooding. Even so, dikes on the Quan River failed.
<br/>
        The resulting flooding caused anywhere from 85,000-240,000 deaths. Entire towns, like the Daowencheng Commune, were entirely wiped out. Due to the technology of the time and the weather conditions, warnings were not received or were misunderstood. Many people in the area did not have a telephone at this time so signals were attempted via telegraph and flares. People acting as messengers to take the warning to towns in person often got caught up in the floods.
    <br/>The Chinese government lists the official death toll as 26,000. They also initially covered up this event. For over 12 years, no one outside of China knew about what happened. They did not allow the media to make any reports. However, in 1987, a Chinese journalist wrote a book about the floods. In 1995, the Henan Daily, the newspaper for the area where the floods took place, published a story about what happened. Finally, in 2005, the government declassified the official documents relating to the dam failure.</p>
    <br/>
    <h3>5. 1935 Yangtse Flood</h3>
    <p>This event followed just a few years after the devastating 1931 floods in the region. Much of the infrastructure that had been rebuilt was damaged once again. And a lot of the measures that had been put in place to reduce flood risks were overcome.<br/>That year, there were a high number of typhoons off the coast of China. This may have created a sudden rise in the river levels on July 6, 1935. Several levees broke, and other areas became flooded when the river spilled over its banks.<br/>

        Over 140,000 people died as a result of the flood. Even more died afterward from starvation. The previous year had been a drought, which meant there were fewer crops than usual. This flood affected over 5500 square miles of farmlands, further reducing the available food in the area. Others died from diseases that spread as a result of the flooding.</p>
